  abstract = {This paper presents trainable methods for extracting principal content
	words from voicemail messages. The short text summaries generated
	are suitable for mobile messaging applications. The system uses a
	set of classifiers to identify the summary words, with each word
	being identified by a vector of lexical and prosodic features. We
	use an ROC-based algorithm, Parcel, to select input features (and
	classifiers). We have performed a series of objective and subjective
	evaluations using unseen data from two different speech recognition
	systems, as well as human transcriptions of voicemail speech.},

	techniques are applied to these transcripts to identify unimportant
	parts of the recording and to excise these, reducing the time taken
	to identify the main points of the recording. However our prior work
	has relied on human-generated as opposed to automatically generated
	transcripts. Our study compares excision methods applied to human-generated
	and automatically generated transcripts with state of the art word
	error rates (38%). We show that both excision techniques provide
	equivalent support for gist extraction. Furthermore, both techniques
	perform better than the standard speedup techniques used in current
	applications. This suggests that excision is a viable technique for
	gist extraction in many practical situations.},

  abstract = {People are often required to catch up on information they have missed
	in meetings, because of lateness or scheduling conflicts. Catching
	up is a complex cognitive process where people try to understand
	the current conversation without access to prior discussion. We develop
	and evaluate a novel Catchup audio player that allows "time-travel".
	It automatically identifies the gist of what was missed, allowing
	people to join the meeting late and still participate effectively.
	In a lab study, we evaluated people's understanding of meetings they
	had partly missed, by asking questions about meeting content. We
	tested whether providing Catchup gist overcomes the potential disadvantage
	that people must join even later - because catching up takes time.
	Catchup users understood meetings 70% better than controls who simply
	joined late. They were more confident of their understanding and
	indicated a positive attitude towards the tool. We are currently
	exploring more general applications of the time-travel approach.},

	This paper develops and evaluates Interactive Compression (IC) techniques
	that allow users to dynamically configure the amount of information
	they view in a document, e.g. by automatically removing unimportant
	information from view (Excision) or by making important information
	more salient (Highlighting). We explore IC techniques in the context
	of meeting transcripts that are typically unstructured - making it
	difficult to isolate relevant regions and extract key information.
	We demonstrate the superiority of IC compared with an unmodified
	text control. In contrast to traditional summaries, our results show
	extensive use of interactive, as opposed to fixed compression level,
	summarization. They also show the value of word- as opposed to utterance-based
	compression. There are also trade-offs between different IC designs.
	Exci- sion allows users to scan documents faster than Highlighting
	but at the expense of overlooking relevant sections of the document.},

  abstract = {Efficient browsing of speech recordings is problematic. The linear
	nature of speech, coupled with the lack of abstraction that the medium
	affords, means that listeners have to listen to long segments of
	a recording to locate points of interest. We explore temporal compression
	algorithms that attempt to reduce the amount of time users require
	to listen to speech recordings, whilst retaining the important content.
	This paper implements two main approaches to temporal compression:
	artificial speech rate alteration (speed-up) and unimportant segment
	removal (excision). We evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches
	by having listeners rate comprehension and listening effort for different
	types of temporal compression. For different compression levels,
	we compare performance of various implementations of speed-up and
	excision as well as techniques based on semantic features and acoustic
	features. Our results indicate that listeners prefer low compression
	levels, excision over speed-up, and algorithms based on semantic
	rather than acoustic features. Finally listeners were negative about
	hybrid algorithms that used speed-up to indicate missing regions
	in an excised recording.},

  abstract = {Although many recent systems have been built to support Information
	Capture and Retrieval (ICR), these have not generally been successful.
	This paper presents studies that evaluate two different hypotheses
	for this failure, firstly that systems fail to address user needs
	and secondly that they provide only rudimentary support for ICR.
	Having first presented a taxonomy of different systems built to support
	ICR, we then describe a study that attempts to identify user needs
	for ICR. On the basis of that study we carried out two user-oriented
	evaluations. In the first we carried out a task-based evaluation
	of a state-of-the-art ICR system, finding that it failed to provide
	users with abstract ways to view meetings data, and did not present
	users with information categories that they considered to be important.
	In a second study we introduce a new method for comparative evaluation
	of different techniques for accessing meetings data. The second study
	showed that simple interface techniques that extracted key information
	from meetings were effective in allowing users to extract gist from
	meetings data. We conclude with a discussion of outstanding issues
	and future directions for ICR research.},

	participants continue their work whilst monitoring the audio for
	topics of interest. Our previous work has established the benefit
	of spatialised audio presentation on improving multitasking performance.
	In this study, we investigate the different spatialisation strategies
	employed by subjects in order to aid their multitasking performance
	and improve their user experience. Subjects were given the freedom
	to place each participant at a different location in the acoustic
	space both in terms of azimuth and distance. Their strategies were
	based upon cues regarding keywords and which participant will utter
	them. Our findings suggest that subjects employ consistent strategies
	with regard to the location of target and distracter talkers. Furthermore,
	manipulation of the acoustic space plays an important role in multitasking
	performance and the user experience.},

	'foreground' task whilst listening in the 'background' for an item

	task without affecting topic detection. Here, we ask whether dichotic
	or spatialised audio presentation of a meeting is less disruptive
	than the single-channel mixture of talkers normally used in teleconference
	audio. A number of talker location configurations are used, and we
	examine how these impact upon a text-based foreground task: finding
	all letter 'e' occurrences in a block of text. Additionally, we examine
	the effect of cueing the listener to direction or gender and record
	listener preferences for audio presentation style. Our results suggest
	that spatialised audio disrupts the foreground task less than single-channel
	audio when direction or gender is cued. Index Terms: multitasking,
